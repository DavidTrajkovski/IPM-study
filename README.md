Individual project for the course: Human-Computer Interaction Design at FCSE Skopje.

IPM (Integrated Pest Management) Study is a study platform. 

The courses are Pests, IPM, Pesticides, DDD and a test for each course with certification as well if the test is successfully passed. 

There is also course progress for each student and list of certificates he owns.

An interesting feature is the professional section for help against pests.
